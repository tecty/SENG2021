We want to help by providing you with information straight from the Board of Studies and from our faculties and staff.\nWhat we'll cover\nWe want to make sure you're familiar with what you'll be doing during HSC subject selection - but also with how your subject selections may affect what adjustment factors (more commonly known as bonus points) you may be eligible for, what the difference is between assumed knowledge and prerequisites and how the uni admission and scholarships application process works. We promise we'll cover all of this in less than an hour (we're rehearsing now). Plus, we'll give you time either before or after the program to speak with our faculties and student services so that you can get information and answers to any specific questions you may have.\nJust one will do\nWe offer a number of Year 10 Subject Selection & Information Evenings during the month of May.

The lecture will be held on Wednesday 2 May, followed by drinks and canapes in UNSW\u2019s newly refurbished Roundhouse.\u00a0\n\nEngineering for understanding: how building quantum devices unveils the meaning of quantum mechanics\nOver a century after the establishment of quantum mechanics, the popular \u2013 and sometimes even the professional \u2013 literature is still permeated by the myth that quantum is weird and no one understands it. Yet, the 21st century will probably go into history as the era of quantum engineering, when the peculiar effects allowed by quantum physics are harnessed to create unprecedented functionalities.\nIn this lecture, Professor Morello will illustrate how the ambitious project of building a quantum computer can help us gaining intimacy with the quantum world and, with it, deepen our conceptual and practical understanding of it.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Pollock Memorial Lectureship\nThe Pollock Memorial Lectureship has been awarded about every four years since 1949 and is sponsored by the University of Sydney and the Society in memory of Professor J.A. Pollock, Professor of Physics at the University of Sydney (1899-1922) and a member of the Society for 35 years.\nProfessor Morello was awarded the 2017 Pollock Lectureship for inventing and demonstrating all of the fundamental building blocks of a silicon quantum computer.\n\n\n\n\nAbout Professor Andrea Morello\nProfessor Andrea Morello is a Professor of Quantum Engineering at UNSW Sydney and a Program Manager in the ARC Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation & Communication Technology. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of NSW, and a Fellow of the American Physical Society. He grew up near Torino and graduated from the Politecnico di Torino in 1998. He then completed his PhD in the birthplace of low-temperature physics, the Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratorium in Leiden, Netherlands, followed by a postdoc at UBC in Vancouver. He joined UNSW in late 2006. He and his team were the first in the world to demonstrate the operation of a single electron and a single nucleus quantum bit in silicon. They still hold the record for quantum memory time, and the most accurate demonstration of quantum entanglement in the solid state. For these achievements, Andrea was awarded a Eureka Prize (2011), the Malcolm McIntosh Prize for Physical Scientist of the Year (2013), the David Syme Research Prize (2013), the NSW Science & Engineering Award (2014), and was the inaugural winner of the R.

If the courts are working,\u00a0nothing can go wrong.\u2019 This was perhaps a direct reference to the\u00a0protection of individual and community rights, a responsibility that courts\u00a0are expected to discharge. Rights include the freedom of speech and\u00a0other rights such as access to the courts. When the judicial system, which\u00a0includes the work of the courts and judges, is criticised from the point of\u00a0view of rights, how do the courts deal with this, for there can be said to be\u00a0possible conflicts of interest? And what are the limits of the criticism that\u00a0can be levelled at courts and judges? In this talk, the speaker will address\u00a0these questions chiefly from experiences gained in Hong Kong, but in\u00a0truth the questions can well apply to the legal system in most jurisdictions.\nSpeaker:\nChief Justice Ma was born in Hong Kong in 1956.

This work has a twin emphasis: translations and knowing. A focus on translations asks how health care technologies are made to work through their implementations in practice. A focus on knowing asks how evidence is made through implementation science and interventions research. Whereas \u2018evidence-based intervention\u2019 approaches tend to imagine stable interventions, with universal effect potential, in an evidence-making intervention approach, interventions are never fixed or stable but multiple, contingent and local. Rather than evidencing interventions as responses to given policy problems, the approach asks how evidence, intervention and problems come to be. Our focus then, is intervention objects and effects as things in-the-making through their materialisations. We use this seminar to think-with the idea of evidence-making intervention. There are multiple ideas here, including: performativity, assemblage, multiplicity, care. We also touch upon ideas for empirical case study: the becoming of methadone treatment, the making of hepatitis C treatment promise, the use of wastewater as a device of knowing drug problems. Following Puig de la Bellacasa, we see this work to potentiate a thinking-with care; a means at once of knowing care and health intervention as a matter of concern, and as a means to generating careful and caring interventions. \nTim Rhodes\u00a0holds joint appointments as a UNSW SHARP Professor of Sociology of Health at the Centre for Social Research in Health, UNSW, and as Professor of Public Health Sociology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He is engaged in qualitative research to explore narratives of care in relation to HIV, hepatitis C and harm reduction, especially among people who inject drugs, with current projects in Kenya, Senegal and the UK. He is Editor of the International Journal of Drug Policy.\nKari Lancaster\u00a0 is a Scientia Fellow at the Centre for Social Research in Health, UNSW. Kari\u2019s research uses critical policy studies approaches (including those informed by poststructural theory and science and technology studies) to contribute to contemporary discussions about emerging issues of policy significance in the fields of drugs and viral hepatitis. Kari\u2019s research has examined how drug policy problems and policy knowledges are constituted, and \u2018evidence-making\u2019 practices in health and social policy.\nJake Rance\u00a0is a Research Fellow with the Centre for Social Research in Health, UNSW. Before joining the Centre he spent a number of years working in harm reduction services in Sydney\u2019s Kings Cross.

But beyond what methods are used, decisions must be made about the sequence in which they are employed, how they inform each other (or not), their collective interpretation, and the ways in which they are presented and discussed.

These studies treat children as adding to the needs of the household but otherwise as invisible, while child poverty is estimated using information provided on and about, adults. In contrast, the deprivation approach pioneered by Townsend adopts a living standards perspective that reflects the views of individuals (including children and young people) about what goods and activities are needed to achieve a minimally acceptable standard and then asks if they have each item. This study is the first attempt to apply the deprivation approach in the Australian context, and will report initial results from a study that applies this new child-centred approach to a sample of around 2,700 young people aged 11-17 years attending a NSW government high school. After briefly describing how the study was conceptualised, developed and conducted, attention will focus on what the findings imply about the extent and nature of child deprivation and how it affects different dimensions of child well-being and (in a limited way) their relationships with family, peers and schooling. The survey was also completed by over 300 young people participating in The Smith Family\u2019s Learning for Life program that provides extra support to encourage disadvantaged children and young people to stay at school longer. Comparisons of results within and between the two samples will be used to highlight how different groups of young people understand and experience poverty.\nPeter Saunders was Director of the Social Policy Research Centre at UNSW from February 1987 until July 2009, and now holds a Research Chair in Social Policy within the Centre. His research interests include poverty and income distribution, household needs and living standards, social security reform, comparative social policy and ageing and social protection in China. He is Australia\u2019s leading poverty researcher and his work in the field has been widely published, nationally and internationally. In 2015-2016 he served as a member of the Advisory Board for the World Bank Commission on Global Poverty.\nMegan Bedford is a Senior Research Officer at the Social Policy Research Centre. She has experience working on projects on poverty, deprivation and social exclusion. The most recently completed project involved developing a set of budget standards for low-paid and unemployed Australians and their families. She is also currently involved in a three-year, mixed method longitudinal study that will track the experiences and educational outcomes of a sample of educational scholarship recipients and their transition from school to further education and employment.\nNeed assistance to register for this seminar?

This bold statement on the behalf of the world\u2019s leaders demands gender equality and inclusive, socially just, sustainable cities. The UN\u2019s call for gender equality dates back twenty years during which time gender mainstreaming has been brought into urban planning and design with varying degrees of success. Since then new issues have emerged, such as resilience and climate change, migration and smart cities. This lecture will explain why gender plus issues are still important for city planners and designers. It will highlight positive examples of intervention from Europe and the global South. The barriers to adopting good practice more widely will be explored. The lecture provokes the question, is gender sensitive planning incorporated into \u2018good\u2019 planning and urban design or is there more for planners, urban designers, architects and policy makers to do?\nAbout the speaker:\nMarion Roberts is Emeritus Professor of Urban Design, Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, University of Westminster, London, UK. She is internationally recognised for two specialisms within the broad field of urban design and planning - gender issues and the urban night - and has published widely in both. Marion recently co-chaired a working group for the European Commission funded COST research and development network genderSTE (2012-2016). Marion also co-edited Fair Shared Cities: The Impact of Gender Planning in Europe (with Ines Sanchez De Madariaga) in 2013.

However, without recognising the developmental importance of decent care arrangements to support working women, and therein a redistribution of care obligations, the decent work agenda risks becoming an inherently patriarchal framework for labour rights in emerging economies like Sri Lanka. \nMatt Withers\u00a0completed his PhD within the Department of Political Economy at the University of Sydney and has since worked as a lecturer and research officer at the same institution. He is currently a postdoctoral fellow with the\u00a0Centre for Global Social Policy\u00a0at the University of Toronto, though remains based in Sydney at the University of New South Wales. His current research addresses temporary labour migration from Sri Lanka and its relationship with crises of production and reproduction. This work frames the strained work and care burdens of migrant domestic workers as a basis for conceptualising the need for \u2018decent care\u2019 regimes, and therein the explicit valuing of care work, as an essential consideration within the broader decent work agenda.\nNeed assistance registering for this event?
